# IEEECubeRobot
Building an automated Rubik's cube solving robot

## Installing the Package
If you have `make` installed (if you are on Windows probably not), you can run:
```
make
```

Otherwise, run:
```
pip install -e .
```
- Doing that command will make sure that it always runs whatever is in the repo currently...
- So if you are working on code, it will always run whatever you have updated. (Using `make` above does the same thing)

### Dependencies
Doing the install will also install dependencies, as long as `requirements.txt` is kept up to date.

## Running the Package
On the command line, run:
```
cube_robot
```
